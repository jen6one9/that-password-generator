# that-password-generator
Passwords are a real security threat. 
This project seeks to deliver an application that generates a random password based on user selected criteria.  
This app will run in the given browser and features HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code.
It is designed to feature a clean and polished user interface and be responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

As an added feature, I added the ability copy the generated password to the clipboard. In addition, I worked to ensure the user is prompted with proper error handling messages if the user did not respond within the applicable required parameters.
